Python 2.7.x

Here is a simple chat server.
It broadcasts text messages from client to all other clients.
Also it broadcasts information about connection/disconnection of clients to server.

You have to specify IP-address and PORT number in command line when you start server and clients.

Every client esteblishes two connections with the server: one for sending messages and one for receiving them.

You can stop sever or client with Ctrl+C combination.
